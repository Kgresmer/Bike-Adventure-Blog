      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>120 is the combined number of spokes on our wheels and the name of this website created to document our travels,
        adventures, and mishaps by bicycle.  We are a Midwestern couple with cycling at our roots, harking back to our
        early days side saddling together around Madison, WI, and Houston, TX.  This website is a collaboration project;
        Kevin coded the majority of the site, while Sigrid designed the graphics and layout.
        <br>

        We are currently en route to San Francisco — on our first long distance bike tour from SEA to SAN — during a
        brief hiatus between jobs and cities. Our route spans a little over 1000 miles down the coast, includes 3 states,
        and will take us about one month to complete.  We are armed with Adventure Cycling Association maps, 5 panniers,
        and the expectation that things can and will go wrong — which is half the fun of biking for us.  You can follow
        our progress here, unless we are having too much fun to write, in which case you can use your imaginations. Happy trails!

          <h2>Sigrid Stensvold</h2>
          <h4><strong>Cyclist, Writer, Designer, Aspiring Front-End Developer</strong></h4>
          <p>Weighing in at 192 lbs (bike & gear included) from Ladysmith, WI, Sigrid discovered touring while
            studying in Bologna, IT, when she and some friends attempted a short bike overnight. They found themselves
            lost in the middle of a field at sunset, only to be saved by a friendly local cyclist. The experience,
            along with a rural milk vending machine, made Sigrid fall cage over toes for the pace and the inevitable misadventures
            of touring.

          <h2>Kevin Gresmer</h2>
          <h4><strong>Cyclist, Full Stack Developer, Designer (sort of), Writer </strong></h4>
          <p>A group effort from Wisconsin, Illinois and Dubai was needed to raise this cyclist. Early on in life he
            dreamed of playing in the NHL, but his love of Legos and lack of talent led to a career as an engineer. He
            became a biker pretty early in life, but it wasn't until college when he would trek through snowy roads of
            Wisconsin on his 1985 Schwinn that he realized, this is the way to travel. </p>
